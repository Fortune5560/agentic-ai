  <h1>Blueprint #2: Research & Reporting Agent</h1>

  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Research is time-intensive, inconsistent, and difficult to verify at scale.
    Autonomous research without validation leads to hallucinations and low trust.
  </p>

  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>
    Build an agent that gathers information autonomously while enforcing
    verification, transparency, and human review.
  </p>

  <h2>System Design</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Autonomous source discovery</li>
    <li>Credibility filtering and ranking</li>
    <li>Multi-step reasoning and synthesis</li>
    <li>Explicit verification loops</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tooling</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Retrieval:</strong> Search APIs, vector databases</li>
    <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> LLM with structured prompts</li>
    <li><strong>Output:</strong> Reports, summaries, citations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Human-in-the-Loop</h2>
  <p>
    Final reports are reviewed and approved by a human
    before distribution or publication.
  </p>

  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <p>
    High-quality, trustworthy research delivered faster,
    with full transparency into sources and reasoning.
